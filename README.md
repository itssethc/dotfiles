# My Dotfiles

Dependencies
  - i3wm with i3-gaps
  - i3status
  - Powerline font from Font Forge if you want to use Powerline in i3bar
  - feh
  - Rofi
  - xcompmgr
  - xrdb
  
i3 config currently has hotkeys set up for st as it's terminal, Rofi replaces dmenu, and Hack (from Nerd Fonts) is it's main font. I use .Xresources to set colors in VS Code (.Xresources Theme), all i3 pieces, nano and st/bash. Use xcompmgr for transparent st. Another would work fine. Bash profile will work with other terminals.
